        <p>K-Eight is fast, easy to extend, and friendly.  Want a channel-admin bot for those times when you can't be around?  K-Eight can do that.  Want a chatbot to lighten up the mood?  K-Eight can do that.  Want a games-master to do all the work so you don't have to?  K-Eight can do that as well.</p>

<h2>What is K-Eight?</h2>

<p>K-Eight is a Python IRC bot designed by <a href="http://johz.wordpress.com">myself</a> using Evan Fosmark's <a href="http://dev.guardedcode.com/projects/ircutils/">IRCUtils</a> to deal with the IRC abstractions.  It is currently in the process of being padded out with extra features such as IRC logging and the whole host of commands and triggers that one expects from a fully-featured IRC bot.  However it is already a powerful tool, with its own internal logging system and a powerful toolkit.</p>

<p>K-Eight is designed around the principle of plugins.  Plugins can be included and excluded easily from a single YAML configuration file, but they can also be modified and added to by anyone who understands how to write a function in Python.  K-Eight will automatically recognise plugin scripts and their contents, but this behaviour can be modified with the plugin decorators, with a very simple but extremely powerful syntax.</p>

<p>K-Eight was named after the presumed predecessor to K-9, the robot dog who for a time followed the Doctor around in the hit television series Doctor Who.  While K-Eight will never have K-9's abilities in handling laser weaponry and sensing the whereabouts of the Key of Time, I hope that you'll have fun using him.</p>
